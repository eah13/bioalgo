##Bioalgorithms

###UNC Chapel Hill Comp 555

This repository contains my answers to the problem sets assigned for Prof. Jan Prins' Bioalgorithms class, taught in the Fall of 2012.  The problem sets are mostly typeset in LaTeX, with some Python code as well.

If you're curious what I was up to, the PDFs under each of the homework folders will show you the assignment and my answers, respectively.

If you're a Bioinformatics Algorithms afficionado, feel free to learn the easy way what packages will help you make hamiltonian paths, spectral convolutions, etc.  In some cases I copped out and used Excel or Omnigraffle, usually because of time constraints.  Homework 5 was completed in about 6 frantic hours and, embarrassingly, many of the graphs are iPhone pictures of pencil diagrams.  You do what you've gotta do in a pinch.

### Content Highlights

As mentioned above, the pdf files of each assignment are in the corresponding folder.  Take a peek.  You know you're curious...
* Homework 1
	* My first [LaTeX document](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw1/555ps1.tex)!  Ever!
	* `pytest3`: my first crappy python program.  Well, it's a script, really
* Homework 2
	* Second [LaTeX document](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw2/555ps2.tex), wherein alignat* was discovered, and there was much rejoincing.
* Homework 3
	* Check out the [Hamiltonian](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw3/555ps3.tex#L94) and [Eulerian](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw3/555ps3.tex#L120) path LaTeX code using the [tikz](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw3/555ps3.tex#L11) package.  Modified from code found on texexample.net	
	* `euler.py`: Finding a Euler path (aka tour) in a directed graph with help from [networkx](http://networkx.lanl.gov).
* Homework 4
	* This is the one where I discovered [lstlisting](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw4/555ps4.tex#L39), the best way I've found to put code or pseudocode into LaTeX.
	* [My best looking Python program yet](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw4/q6.py).  Starting to look more Pythonic.
* Homework 5
	* aka. "The Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Homework quality."  Nothing to brag about with LaTeX really, but I did make a sweet [Hidden Markov Model diagram](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw5/hmm.jpg) with Omnigraffle.  Oh, and by now I also rock [equations](https://github.com/eah13/bioalgo/blob/master/hw5/555ps5.tex#L226) like no sweat.  That's one of the most fun parts of LaTeX: writing sweet looking math.
